                            Mumbai : The state on Saturday reported 2,739 new Covid-19 cases
                            and 120 more deaths, taking the tally and toll to 82,968 and 2,969
                            respectively, as the government moved towards easing curbs in a graded manner,
                            which includes BEST resuming bus operations, albeit with restrictions,
                            in the city from Monday — around three months after it was shut owing to the pandemic.
                            The state expects the coronavirus curve to start flattening within the next 10 days.

                        <p>
                            Tope announced on Saturday that the state government will procure 10,000
                            vials of Remdesivir injection. “The injection proved effective against
                            SARS infection and is expected to be beneficial for coronavirus too as
                            suggested by the World Health Organisation (WHO). We have decided to purchase
                            10,000 vials of the injection from the Corporate Social Responsibility fund of
                            corporate houses,” he said.

                            virus spread from China – where it first originated in December 2019
                            – to find a strong foothold in Europe, the number of fatalities 
                            doubled to 200,000 in another 15 days.

                                    At 246,472 cases, India on Saturday overtook Italy to become the 
                                    country with the sixth-highest number of Covid-19 infections. 
                                    However, with a death toll of 6,873 from the disease and a 
                                    fatality rate of 2.8% till Saturday, it is significantly 
                                    lower than the case fatality rate of other hard-hit nations 
                                    such as the US (5.6%), UK (14.2%) and Italy (14.4%).
                                    Experts say the number of deaths from the pandemic is a more 
                                    accurate representation of the virus’ prevalence in a region 
                                    instead of the number of infections, as a large percentage of 
                                    Covid-19 cases are asymptomatic and are never officially reported.
